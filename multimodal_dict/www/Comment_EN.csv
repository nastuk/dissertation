academic;adjective / noun;1581 / 1587;The word «academic» (adjective+noun) was borrowed from Middle French “achademique, academique” and Latin “Acadēmicus” «of the school of the philosopher Plato », from Greek “Akadḗmeia”, a place where Plato (c. 428-347 BC) taught. ;The Akadēmeia, a park and gymnasium located near Athens, was named in honor of the legendary hero Akadēmos, who helped to rescue Helen (the most beautiful woman of Greece and the indirect cause of the Trojan War) by revealing to her brothers the place where she was hidden after she was abducted by Theseus . During the 4th century BC Plato taught in a garden in Athens called the Akadēmeia, which was named after this ancient hero. It was there that Plato established his school, which is, in name at least, the grandfather of all modern academies.
education;noun;1531;The word «education» (noun) was borrowed from Latin verb “ēducāre”, which meant «bring up, rear» as well as more specifically «educate» and was related to “ēdūcere” «lead out». The original metaphor was probably that of leading someone out of childhood and into the world. ;The education system in the UK is divided into four main parts, primary education, secondary education, further education and higher education. Children in the UK have to legally attend primary and secondary education which runs from about 5 years old until the student is 16 years old.
examination;noun;14th century;The word «examination» (noun) was borrowed in Middle English from Old French “examiner” and Latin “examinare” «weigh, test», from “examen” literally «tongue of a balance». The word’s use for ‘a test of knowledge’ is recorded early in its history.  ;The major national examinations in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales are the General Certificate of Secondary Education and the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (A level). In Scotland they are the Standard Grades, the Highers, and the Advanced Highers. These public examinations are externally assessed by external examiners, although schools and other institutions may set their own examinations. The word «exam» as a college student slang shortened form of examination appeared in 1848. 
manager;noun;1588;The word «manager» (noun) was borrowed from Italian “maneggiare”, based on Latin “manus” «hand». The early sense recorded for the verb “manage” was ‘put (a horse) through the paces of the manège’ (= training in a enclosed area). ;The Education Reform Act 1988 resulted in a shift of much of the responsibility for the management of schools from the local authority to the schools themselves. This was known as Local Management of Schools (LMS). Part of the purpose for this reform was to encourage market competition between schools. One notable consequence has been a growth in the use of business and management terminology within the education sector. All this has been reflected in the range of professional development programmes and qualifications in the field of management which are now available to leaders and aspiring leaders of educational institutions. 
professional;adjective / noun;1606 / 1811;"The word «professional» (adjective + noun) was borrowed from “prōfessus”, the past participle of Latin “profitēri” «to declare publicly». A “professor” is etymologically someone who ‘makes a public claim’ to knowledge in a particular field; and someone’s “profession” is the area of activity in which they ‘profess’ a skill or competence. ";
school;noun / verb;before the 12th century / 15th century;The word «school» (noun) was developed from Old English “scōl, scolu” «place for instruction» that came via Latin from Greek “skholē” «leisure, philosophy, lecture-place». This originally denoted «leisure», and only gradually developed through «leisure used for intellectual argument or education» and finally “school” «the building». ;"1. Christian missionaries established schools throughout Europe, and St. Augustine of Canterbury is said to have established the first English school in 598. The first school known to have been designated as ‘High School’ in Great Britain was established in Edinburgh in 1519. 
2. Schools in Britain as educational institutions may be identified according to the age of the pupils: pre-schools/nursery schools/infant schools/junior schools (collectively termed primary schools), and secondary schools. They may also be identified according to whether they are maintained (state) schools, academies, or public (private, fee-charging) schools. Secondary schools may be designated grammar schools or comprehensive schools. Schools which are supported by recognized religious organizations are known as faith or denominational schools; and those with sponsorship from industry and commerce are called trust schools. 
3. At Oxford University the word «school» can refer to a course leading to a first degree, and to all those who work within that subject. And in the U.S. it is often used to designate either a department devoted to one subject or a grouping of several subject departments. 
4. Early on the word “school” was confused with the Dutch word “schole” «crowd, multitude», which went on to become English “shoal” «multitude (of fish)». The upshot of this confusion was that the phrase, “school of fish”, became more popular in the US than the original “shoal of fish”. "
science;noun;14th century;The word «science» (noun) was borrowed from Old French “scientia”, from Latin “scīre” «know». ;"Originally science was knowledge in general, or any branch of knowledge, including the arts. The restricted modern sense of science, concentrating on the physical and natural world, dates from the 18th century. In the Middle Ages, “the seven (liberal) sciences” was often used synonymously with “the seven liberal arts”, for the group of studies comprised by the Trivium (Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, Astronomy). The derivative ""scientist"" was coined in 1840 by William Whewell: ‘We need very much a name to describe a cultivator of science in general. I should incline to call him a Scientist.’ Philosophy of the Inductive Science 1840. "
student;noun;15th century;The word «student» (noun) was borrowed via Old French “estudie” from Latin “stadium” «zeal, painstaking application» hence «application to learning». This probably went back ultimately to the Indo-european base “*steud-, *teud-” «hit», which also produced Latin “tundere” «hit» (source of English “contusion” and “obtuse”) and German “stossen” «shove, hit» – the underlying notion of “study” thus being the «application of extreme effort».  ;"The word «student» is usually used in the tertiary sector at college or university, those enrolled in primary/elementary schools are called ""pupils"", although it is not unusual to refer to older pupils in schools as ‘students’, too. In the United States for high school and university, the students are named according to the year of studying: 1st year – freshman, 2nd year – sophomore, 3rd year – junior, 4th year – senior. "
teacher;noun;14th century;"The word «teacher» (noun) goes back ultimately to the prehistoric Indo-European base “*deik-” shared by Greek ""deiknunai"" «show» and Latin ""dīcere"" «say» (source of English diction, dictionary, etc.). Old English “tǣcan” meant «to show, point out, declare, demonstrate». from Proto-Germanic ""*taikijan"" «to show» an Indo-European root ";Although most usually referring to one who teaches in a school, the title of ‘teacher’ also applies in a wider context to include professionals in other educational institutions, as well as those working outside such institutions who nevertheless have a pedagogical role, such as giving instruction in the playing of a musical instrument. Thus, ‘teacher’ may be taken to cover a range of more specific terms which, as well as ‘lecturer’, include ‘trainer’, ‘instructor’, and ‘tutor’. 
university;noun;14th century;The word «university» (noun) is a Middle English adaptation of French “université”, derived from Medieval Latin “universitas” «society, community». Its current use resulted from a shortening of the original phrase, “universitas magistrorum et scholarium” «community of masters and scholars». The base is Latin “universus” «combined into one». ;"1. The first universities to be established in England were Oxford and Cambridge, which were both founded in the 13th century. In Scotland, St Andrews, Aberdeen, and Glasgow were the earliest, dating back to the 15th century; Edinburgh was established in 1582. Following the Second World War, there was a very rapid expansion, including the founding of the universities of York, Warwick, and Lancaster in the 1960s. These universities were known as ‘new universities’ to distinguish them from the older institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, and Durham, and the red-brick universities founded at the turn of the century. 
2. The phrase «alma mater», used with reference to a university or college once attended appeared in the 17th century, and first had the general sense ‘someone or something providing nourishment’. It was a title given by the Romans to several goddesses but in particular to Ceres and Cybele, both representing fostering mother-figures. "
